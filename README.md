# Fit-Progress

Inspired by Apple's new framework, Swift Charts, I am building a progress tracking app for weight lifters. 

## Design Process

Here is the layout of each screen of Fit Progress that I designed on my iPad using Microsoft OneNote.  
The goal here was to design a complete MVP of the app.

### Figma Screen Design

Next, I used the Figma app to layout the screens of my sketch to get an idea on how they would look using native iOS design resources from the Figma community. Laying out all of the screens in Figma had me re-thinking a couple of things about my overall app design, so a couple of screens had a complete overhaul compared to my initial sketch. With that in mind, I figure some of the Figma screens may change during development as well.
