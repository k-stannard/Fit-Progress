# Fit-Progress

As an avid weight lifter, I am always tracking my progress for all of my exercises in my Notes app. It becomes a hassle when I want to view my progress across several months of logs. I decided to make an app to make it more convenient to gauge my gym progress, and will allow me to make changes to my program much more swiftly. I was inspired by Apple's new framework, Charts, to visualize this progress in one place and make sure there is a steady upward trend over time.

## Design Process

Before drawing up my designs, I took a glance at some current fitness apps on the App Store. I wasn't too happy with the visuals of what had found there, so I decided to make it my goal to make the app look like a native iOS app.  

Here is the layout of each screen of Fit Progress that I designed on my iPad using Microsoft OneNote, with the intention of designing a complete MVP of the app.

### Figma Screen Design

Next, I used the Figma app to layout the screens of my sketch to get an idea on how they would look using native iOS design resources from the Figma community. Laying out all of the screens in Figma had me re-thinking a couple of things about my overall app design, so a couple of screens had a complete overhaul compared to my initial sketch. With that in mind, I figure some of the Figma screens may change during development as well.
